### Difference in differences definition


Difference in differences (you’ll find it as DiD, DD, or Diff-in-Diff as well) is a statistical technique used in econometrics and quantitative research. This will be done as a natural experiment when there’s no possible any randomnization. It calculates the effect of a treatment (i.e., an explanatory variable or an independent as more sunlight exposure to sunflower ) on an outcome (i.e., a response variable or dependent variable as number of seeds) by comparing the average change over time in the outcome variable for the treatment group to the average change over time for the control group. This method may still be subject to certain biases (e.g., mean regression, reverse causality and omitted variable bias).

Here's you'll find a streamlit app code and an example data file to learn how to use it.
